<p> Hi, I am Ecaterina Arhire!!!
I am passionate about solving software engineering problems. I enjoyed working on the project using Oracle SQL. In addition, 
I learned and improved my skills as a web developer in the summer of 2020. The study at the university opened OOP and Java programming. Now, I love programming using Java, OOP principles, and Android Studio.
